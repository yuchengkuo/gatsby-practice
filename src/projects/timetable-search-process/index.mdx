#### // Intro

## Overview

This project is a self-implemented practice for better experience and interface design skills, and the idea comes from personal struggle with the current product. The main goal was to redesign a more intuitive and fluent process for timetable search.

## Discovery

### Background

Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) is the train transportation in Taiwan.

Recently released (2019) fourth generation of the ticket booking system offers common services like ticket booking, timetable searching, and live train info. Thereâ€™re other third party apps provide similar

This project covers the redesign of the mainly used service, search process for timetable.

### The problems

The main problem of the current search process is tedious and time-consuming, especially when the user need to switch between the departure and arrival stations often.

### The challenges

- Large amount of the stations and counties (242 stations & 19 counties)
- 3 ways to show the results
- Subline / mainline (7 sublines)

### Current analysis

For [official TRA app](link to app), I throughly analyzed the current product and experience, hoping to discover the opportunities to improve the experience.

Other apps for train timetable also have similar search process.

## Define

### Design goal

The focus will be on the search process, the main goal is to reduced search time by 40%.

### Ideation

### User flow

The user flow shows how the users will interact with the product and help me identify what user could encounter during the search process.

<CustomWidth
  image={props.images[3]}
  width={"60vw"}
  overlay={false}
  alt={
    "User flowchart from start the search process to three different types of results"
  }
/>

### Wireframes

I did lots of explorations in wireframes to show how the structure and break the whole interface into components for better reusability.

<CustomWidth
  image={props.images[4]}
  width={"60vw"}
  overlay={false}
  shadow={false}
  alt={"Eight wireframes of the resigned app"}
/>

### Wire flow

Combine the usr flowchart ang the wireframe to get more sense of how the search process will look and how it will work.

<CustomWidth
  image={props.images[5]}
  width={"80vw"}
  overlay={false}
  shadow={false}
  alt={"wireflow for the main user flow"}
/>

### Lo-fi prototype

Arcu adipiscing sed accumsan, ac metus, quis nibh potenti risus Arcu adipiscing sed accumsan, ac metus, quis nibh potenti risus.

<CustomWidth

  width={"80vw"}
  overlay={false}
  shadow={false}
  alt={"wireflow for the main user flow"}
/>

## Design

With how it will work in mind, I moved on to the visual design, after some attempt and exploration I find this version the most clear and simple.

### Search tab

The search tab consists of current departure and arrival stations, date and time, train type and recent search history.

<CustomWidth
  image={props.images[7]}
  width={"70vw"}
  overlay={false}
  alt={
    "Screenshots of redesigned search tab, recent search history, date popup"
  }
/>

### Search popup

Two ways of searching

<CustomWidth
  image={props.images[8]}
  width={"70vw"}
  overlay={false}
  alt={"Screenshots of redesigned search popup, using filter, input text"}
/>

### Saved tab

The saved tab contains two different types of data user saved, time and stations, by clicking on the time item will update the stations and time and bring the user back to the search tab, in case the user want to change the info (like time and date). And the saved stations lead to the train results for that specific one.

<CustomWidth
  image={props.images[9]}
  width={"70vw"}
  overlay={false}
  alt={"Screenshots of redesigned search popup, using filter, input text"}
/>

### Result page

Arcu adipiscing sed accumsan, ac metus, quis nibh potenti risus

<CustomWidth
  image={props.images[10]}
  width={"70vw"}
  overlay={false}
  alt={"Screenshots of redesigned search popup, using filter, input text"}
/>

## Develop

### Interactive Prototype
