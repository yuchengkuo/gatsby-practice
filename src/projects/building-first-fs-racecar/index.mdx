#### // Intro

## Overview

> This is a project about discovery, teamwork, and passion.üî•

As new technology evolves much more quickly, the rapid advancement of industry makes it harder for undergrad students to keep up. Therefore, we were hoping through this project we can closer the gap and also discover new possibilities.

This project started at my junior year at NCKU, with less than 10 members to begin(30 when season ended). **The primary goal was to build a formula-style racecar to compete in Formula Student (FS) event.** As one of the kick-off members, I had the opportunity to execute and learn end to end. It was a wild ride and special experience for me.ü§òüèº

### The Competition

Formula Student (or [Formula SAE](https://www.fsaeonline.com/) in some countries) is one of the biggest student events around the world, **whose purpose is giving undergrad students an opportunity for practical application skills**.

The teams shall think themselves as a small-scale vehicle manufacturer to design, develop and produce a formula-style racecar, working on various aspects like operating, designing, manufacturing and marketing. **As for now, more than 20 events and 200 teams are active around the world**.

There are two events in the competition, static event and dynamic event. Static event is about rule-compliance, safety, strategy, and business presentation, dynamic is about the performance on track. **Teams have to pass the static technical inspection to join dynamic event.**

> We participated in Formula Student Japan 2019, which was held at late Aug.

### Competition Type

**There are three main classes in the competition, combustion, electric and autonomous.** Combustion started at 1980s, which has the longest history and most resources, therefore it‚Äôs easiest to begin and has largest amount of teams. Electric was introduced in 2010s, with the increase of difficulty, resources taken and issue of safety, while the project aspects are wider than combustion gasoline. Autonomous started at 2019, which is the most advanced, now teams and competitions are mostly in Europe and US.

> We aimed for electric class for broader diversity and promising trend of EV.‚ö°Ô∏è

#### // Process

This project took 12 months to build out the vehicle, and the overall timeline was research, design, develop, test and finally participate in the race, which consisted of different iterations and timeline for each sunbeam.

<Process />

###### 01

## Research

We started with getting familiar with the competition and did some research about how an entry-year team should be aiming in the first attempt. From reading the [competition rules](#), learning from documentations, and looking for advice from experienced teams, the idea was to build up the necessary knowledge as soon as possible.

### Key Findings

We learned that most of the team spent 1+ years for their first attempt, so setting an appropriate goal would be crucial for us. And **FS is usually viewed as a degree-level project, sometimes considered a standard by automobile industry for engineering students to transition from university to workspace.** As a student-centric event, safety is undoubtly the first consideration, therefore strictness of the inspection could be imagined, that is, it won‚Äôt be easy for first-year university and students.

### Project Goal

Realizing the project scope and the competition, we had a better picture of what this competition provides and why it has worldwide popularity, then moved on to define the project goal.

> Desgin and develop the first electric racecar to finish the static event. (Further to join the dynamic event if possible.)

### The Challenge

- Where does the resources (financial and material) come from?
- How much resources do we need?
- How to find members we need / team building?
- What should we pay attention to first?

> **Reach out & Look for help**

We first pitched this idea to the experienced and alumus, looking for advice and potential assistances. Thankfully we received many encouragement and valuable advice, which became a huge boost for us.

We recruited more members first from acquaintances, and then started building more presence through some campaigns (club festival, etc) to reach out to those with different background. It's a challenge to infect others when we had nothing but only passionate heart.

Finally we spent time visiting other experienced team, [NTHU Racing](https://www.facebook.com/NTHU.Racing), [STUST Racing](https://www.facebook.com/ST.RacingTeam2005), and [Taipei Tech Racing](https://www.facebook.com/TaipeiTechRacing/). Actually seeing what they've built and listening to their stories really taught us a lot (and realized it's going to be tough.ü§ûüèº)

On the other hand, often time we found ourselves lost in sudden amout of informationü§Ø, filtering and transforming them into future plans were what we managed to learned.

## Design

> This section will focus on frame design.

I started the design process by reading other teams‚Äô design documentations, tried to understand their process and take their final result as reference and inspiration. These were the questions I tried to answer when looking at their designs,

- Why do them design this way?
- Identify constrains and advantages.
- What‚Äôs good and potential improvements?
- How's the results?

Listing these questions out helped me understand what to focus and and prioritize top consideration for our case. Then I started do some sketches to get more acquainted with the frame structure and also ideate possible application. After that I began modeling using software (SolidWorks), revisited the process, made adjustments, then started over again. Few times of iterations quickly get me on track and move on to the bigger iteration with different subteams. Discussing, modifying and iterating became routine until the end of the design phase (technically it‚Äôs end of the season).

### Design Goals

With all the research findings, advices obtained and ideas come-up, the goals for frame design were set,

1. Reduce complexity
2. Compact space usage
3. Easy modification (in software)

### The Challenges

- How to keep the design up-to-date?
- How to manage design versioning?
- How to collaborate with other subteams?

> **Discuss & Understand**

For me, **designing frame is more like figuring out a way to integrate all components onto vehicle with different subteams.** Therefore it‚Äôs essential to know the basic of the components on the car.

We discussed frequently to keep everyone on the same page, and when there‚Äôs change or idea, it could be quickly implemented. Furthermore, it‚Äôs a must to understand why the modifications were needed and different subteams‚Äô goals and constraints, almost always theirs were also one for frame in some way.

Usually frame subteam was the first to take action in order to have the basic structure and then keep modifying until the end of the design phase, that is begin the first while finish the last.

## Develop

(After countless design changes we finally made it to the development!üõ†)

The development process wasn‚Äôt at sync for every subteams and components on the vehicle, thus cooperation across the team was especially important. **For frame, the major tasks were material (steel tubes and sheet metal), pre-development preparation (tube end for welding, sheet metal bending), development (welding), and validation.** For most of the development process, lacking practical experience was a problem for us, apart from picking up the skills beforehand, collaboration with the industry is another strategy.

### Collaborate with the industry

Reaching out to the industry and local corporations let us know practical applications being used right now. And we also learned that been designed and ready to develop are two things, there are many prerequisites like drawing, material, timeline confirmation before getting into development. **Working with the industry taught us more about professional workflow, and also started to understand the industry standards.** Really appreciate the assistance and advice every company gave!

Note: At this time, we were facing competition documents to hand in, development process, final exams,ü•≤

### The Challenges

- How to solve problems that come up during development?
- How to collaborate between different subteams?
- How to coordinate when timeline collide?
- Timeline delay?

> **Identify & Evaluate**

It could be said that it‚Äôs impossible not having problems when entering development, especially for us amateur team. For problems appeared in the development phase, normally we identified what‚Äôs the impact, and thought and discussed about how to solve them, tried to lower the influence as possible.

Timeline collaboration between different subteams was another lesson for us, well communication across the team played an important part, the key was to keep everyone in the situation so that development could keep moving forward.

Also having a plan B is essential to make sure the development could continue with a backup even in the worst situation. (Well, better said than done, it‚Äôs more complicated than what we thought.)

## Test

The testing was not only for validation of our designs, but also for driver to get acquainted with the vehicle (even though the time is basically none). **We also ran through the competition items to make sure everything was ready and to let us know what to do when similar situations occur.**

Before getting into the competition, teams have to submit a video of vehicle in operation, (Shakedown Certificate), in a way to make sure teams are ready for competition. We still vividly remembered the first time it moved after so many sleepless nights.

### The Challenges

- Looking for the testing site.
- What items to test?
- Procedure when problems occur.
- Transportation to competition site.

At this time the problems usually showed up suddenly, we must learn to react quickly and address accordingly. What we could do was trying to lower the chances and building a procedure to address the situation.

## Compete

Before getting into the competition, the shipment from Taiwan to Japan took approximate 3 weeks, we focused on presentation and design documentation then.

### On-site

**For FS Japan 2019, there were 98 teams, with 27 electric vehicles participating and 4 teams from Taiwan.** The competition was 5 days long, 3 for static event and 2 for dynamic event. As mentioned, the team has to pass the static inspection to compete in the dynamic event for safety concern. And for electric class, teams have to pass both technical and electrical inspection to be qualified in dynamic.

First and second half day of the static event wasn‚Äôt that smooth but we took it one step at a time. The challenges were we had to quickly be in the situation since the competition wasn‚Äôt so long, every team were busy getting into the the event, especially inspection. If the team didn‚Äôt pass the inspection, they have to modify their vehicle according to comments of the judges, therefore it‚Äôs essential to identify the problem and form a solvable way quickly.

The most important things to consider was rule-compliance, safety, and communication between judges.

We were stuck at the final check for electric system, we couldn‚Äôt find the cause for the problems. Therefore we lost the chance to finish the dynamic event. It‚Äôs really a pity for us not be able to join the dynamic event. Though, we still passed the inspection using the rest of the competition, which can be seen as a qualification for all of us.

For the last 2 days, apart from enjoying the dynamic eventüèéÔ∏è, we also spent lots of time learning from the judges and other teams. It was brilliant to find so many passionate hearts and be able to share experiences and thoughts about the competition with each other. Besides, we grab the chance to chat with the design judges, we were so glad that some designs were recognized for a first year electric team, and it clearly showed us what could be achieved with the effort from both industry and academic.

Note: For 27 EVs, 11 passed the inspection, 9 joined the dynamic event, 7 finished the race, e ended up 13 out of 27. More information about the completion results can be found [here](jsae).

## Lesson Learned

### Self-education

The knowledge and tool were mostly new (or unfamiliar) to us, thus learning by ourselves became basic skill we must have. It can be said that learning is one of the core reasons this project exists.

### Cross-division collaboration

It‚Äôs impossible to have these great achievements without teamwork,

Members with different backgrounds

Make the conversations effective

### Problems solving techniques

The whole journey in this project was full of problems, not only technically but also team operational and many more. This is the lesson that I feel the most after the season ended.
