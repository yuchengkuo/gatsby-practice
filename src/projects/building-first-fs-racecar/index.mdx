#### // Intro

## Overview

> This is a project about discovery, teamwork, and passion.🔥

As new technology evolves much more quickly, the rapid advancement of industry makes it harder for undergrad students to keep up. Therefore, we were hoping through this project we can closer the gap and meanwhile discover new possibilities.

This project started at my junior year at NCKU, with less than 10 members to begin(30 when season ended). **The primary goal was to build a formula-style racecar to compete in Formula Student (FS) event.** As one of the kick-off members, I had the opportunity to execute and learn end to end. It was a wild ride and special experience for me.🤘🏼

### The Competition

Formula Student (or [Formula SAE](https://www.fsaeonline.com/) in some countries) is one of the biggest student events around the world, **whose purpose is giving undergrad students an opportunity for practical application skills**.

The teams shall think themselves as a small-scale vehicle manufacturer to design, develop and produce a formula-style racecar, working on various aspects like operating, designing, manufacturing and marketing. **As for now, more than 20 events and 200 teams are active around the world**.

There are two events in the competition, static event and dynamic event. Static event, which is about “Is the vehicle compliant to the rule and safe enough?” & “Why did you design this way?”, and dynamic event, focusing on “How's the performance on track?”. **The team has to pass the static technical inspection to join dynamic event.**

> We participated in Formula Student Japan 2019, which was held at late Aug.

### Competition Type

There are three main classes in the competition, combustion, electric and autonomous. Combustion started at 1980s, which has the longest history and most resources, therefore it’s easiest to begin and has largest amount of teams. Electric was introduced in 2010s, with the increase of difficulty, resources taken and issue of safety, while the project aspects are wider than combustion gasoline. Autonomous started at 2019, which is the most advanced, now teams and competitions are mostly in Europe and US.

> We aimed for electric class for broader diversity and promising trend of EV.⚡

#### // Process

This project took 12 months to build out the prototype vehicle. The overall timeline was, research, design, develop, test, and finally participate in the race.

###### 01

## Research

We started with getting familiar with the competition and did some research about how an entry-year team should be aiming in the first attempt. From reading the [competition rules](link), and looking for advice from experienced teams, having a basic idea of future as soon as possible was a must.

### Key Findings

We learned that most of the team spent 1+ years for their first attempt, thus setting an appropriate goal would be crucial for us. **And FS is usually viewed as a degree-level project, sometimes considered a standard by automobile industry for engineering students to transition from university to workspace.** As a student-centric event, safety is undoubtly the first consideration, therefore strictness of the inspection could be imagined and it’s not easy for a first-year university and students.

Realizing the project scope and the competition, we have a better picture of what this competition provides and why it has worldwide popularity.

### Project Goal

The overall project goal was set to be,

> Desgin and develop the first electric racecar to at least pass the static inspection, join the dynamic event if possible.

### The Challenge

- Where does the resources (financial and material) come from?
- How much resources do we need?
- How to find members we need / team building?
- What should we pay attention to first?

> Reach out & Look for help

We first pitched this idea to the experienced and alumus, looking for advice and potential assistances. Thankfully we received many encouragement and valuable advice, which became a huge boost for us.

We recruited more members first from acquaintances, and then started building more presence through some campaigns (club festival, etc) to reach out to those with different background. It's a challenge to infect others when we had nothing but only passionate heart.

Finally, we spent time visiting other experienced team, like [NTHU Racing](link), [STUST Racing](), and [Taipei Tech Racing](). Actually seeing what they've built and listening to their stories really taught us a lot (and realized it's going to be tough🤞🏼).

On the other hand, often time we found ourselves lost in sudden amout of information🤯, organizing and transforming them into future plans was what we managed to learn.

## Design

> This section will focus on the frame design.

I started the design process by reading other teams’ design documentations (researching again), and tried to understand their process and take their final result as reference and inspiration. These were the questions I tried to answer,

- Why do them design this way?
- Identify constrains and advantages.
- What’s good and potential improvements?
- How's the results?

LIsted these questions out helped me understand what to focus and and prioritize top consideration for our case. Then I started do some sketches to get more acquainted with the frame structure and ideate some possible applications. After that I began modeling using software (SolidWorks), revisited the process, made adjustments, then started over again. Few times of the iterations quickly get me on track so as to move on to the bigger iteration with different subteams. Discussing, modifying and iterating become routine until the end of the design phase (actually is end of season).

### Design Goal

With all the research findings, advices obtained and ideas come-up, the goals for frame design were set,

1. Reduce complexity
2. Make most use of space (compact)
3. Easy to modify (in software)
4. Safe (for sure)

### The Challenge

- How to keep the design up-to-date?
- How to manage design versioning?
- How to collaborate with other subteams?

> **Discuss & Understand**

Discuss frequently so when there’s a change, it could be modified and confirmed in no time. Also understand why these changes are needed and what’s other divisions’ challenges. For better integration, it’s essential to understand the basic of the components on vehicle.

## Develop

There are tons of components on the vehicle, we first had to identify what we could build on our own, what could directly use the ready-made products, and what we should work together with corporations.
For frame development, the major tasks are material preparation and metal welding, the tube-end
I had learned welding for 1.5 month at summer 2018, I hope that it could help the frame development quicker.
